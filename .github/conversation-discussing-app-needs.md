Wow! Code master!!
Rocky — 1/5/26, 10:11 PM
bots been down a couple days I'm working on a more permanant hosting solution, I was just running it on my laptop and that's prone to dying and just not good to host, so I got distracted coding something else but the bot should be back up and running tonight I hope

whoops didn't know that hotkey sorry lol
dude I never realized just how much you have to walk users through EVERYTHING with UI, like ik that sounds like a dumb remark like no shit it's the user interface, but I never realized how many people will just say something is going wrong because they're doing it wrong. Like because I didn't lock down viewing of every channel except the one you're supposed to put your tag in in discord, and even though it's labeled and at the top and literally right in front of you emani was like "it's not working" which like no foul to him it's my own bad I just never realized how like handholdy you have to be to get someone through setup/preliminary steps ig just a good lesson to me thought I'd share, I appreciate all the compliments you never let me know if you still needed that project or like what the purpose of it is. I stg it was like a scheduler you said like a mix of two apps but I just cannot remember it for the life of me, if you want me to work on it though I got through pretty much all the personal projects I needed to get through to actually run apps I've made previously (I can host my own server for websites & minecraft & the discord bot all at the same time 24/7 in the background [no extra windows] while my pc is on, I'm working on a private VPN rn (they have services for this but me being me) but that's out in the future bc I still need to do more research into the security of actually exposing it to being "publicly" accessible so I can use it for it's intended purpose), my point is, I have time, I have no projects, if you still need an app built let me know what it is in like a somewhat concise way and I'm happy to make it happen. The one shit thing about developing ios apps if I remember is I have to use xcode (apple's inbuilt ide) so my productivity is like 1/10thed, but I can make it work, I can probably link xcode's compiler to vs code somehow, and either way there are ways make pretty much any programming language into an app, so just lmk if you still are
in need of a program for your needs
idk if you are but if you do I need more portfolio projects & I'd be happy to help the best I can
Man — 1/9/26, 9:06 PM
You know Uber has 3 separate apps… I was thinking of something like that, but I couldnt remember if you said it was expensive?
Yeah, you are extremely good at coding, so people often get lazy and rely completely on you for the quick fix rather than using their brain lol.. I appreciate you for putting so much effort into making this team official af bruv. You Rock (Pun intended lol)
Rocky — 1/10/26, 1:10 PM
lol thx dawg, and yea I do, it’s not expensive it’s expensive in time, depending on the service you need it’s really quite simple
it gets more and more complex the more behaviors need to be handled, if payments need to be processed it’s another library, if you want google maps that’s an API, basically the building blocks already exist the simpler you can make the goal the better the agent is at sticking to building around that and the quicker it will be, but if you want a scheduler with payment processing and event handling so it only allows scheduling at open times and when you’re not already in an appointment or something the logic is simple enough but it is alot of logic, so like whatever you need don’t worry so much about the time or money, it’s free to code, the only thing I pay for is AI access so it’s not costing me more, I just need a clear goal of what the app(s) need to do, yes 3 interlinked apps is possible, 3 apps from the same base API (like all sharing a payment service) is as well, don’t worry so much about the logistics just what is needed if anything, if you need an app that is possible, if you need 3 apps also possible (idk how attainable for me as an individual in a reasonable amount of time, but possible)
Rocky — 1/10/26, 1:18 PM
basically if you can say I need it to do this is and this I can probably send you a website or dev environment that day doing those things, if you have a clearer goal for the project I can keep working and implementing things in tandem with that idea, whatever you need built can be built don’t worry so much about the logistics or how it can be done, that’s my specialty
3 independent apps is a massive amount of time, but technically no different than 1 app with 3 different service tabs
publishing is another story to get something on the app store is out of my control and in apple’s hands, so I could do something like a web app and a regular app until the regular app gets published so it’s functional, apparently doing something quick research though google says “90% of appd get reviewed within 24 hours” so it could be way quicker than I’m expecting, I’m just a realist and I know how some of these tech companies are with review times
Man — 1/10/26, 4:31 PM
Bro, you are extremely filthy. I never knew any of that, but you simplified it very well. I would definitely not feel right if down the line, the apps you made make me millions and you did it for free. If I start to make money off of this, I would be honored to work out a percentage plan, where you receive a certain percentage of the best 2 years of my sales. For example, if I make 20,000 first year if you got 5% you’d get 1,000, and the next year if it were 50,000, you’d get 2,500 more, total of 3,500z If there is a better year after the 2 years, you would get paid the difference between my worst year and that year. So basically if I make a million, you would receive $49,000 on 5% because of the difference between the worst year and the new top 2 years. If I made 2 million the next year, you would get 97,500. I dont have it perfected, but I feel that would be a respectful agreement, and after this, we would potentially negotiate partially ownership maybe, and/or partnership in new ideas.
Rocky — 1/11/26, 1:58 AM
absolutely, the money isn't the deciding factor for me, it's nice to have but I don't need it to do work, hell I've written atleast a million lines of code in the past year and not gotten paid a cent, it would be nice to get paid but also like 🤷‍♂️
you could give me stock or we could work something out when the app is done and making money, up to that point don't worry about reembursement
it helps my prospects of a job, and I just genuinely enjoy it, I just made my service manager live pull from github so my pc (which always runs) is able to get code from github and automatically run it 24/7, basically a "free" server, it's just fun to me, games are really damn difficult it's alot but possible and something I've been interested in, so idk if you got an idea let me know and I'd be happy to have a design partner
game, application, whatever you need/want if it's software based lmk and I'll do it, if it's for in person services (like you're a handyman or an "uber" like service [although you'd get more business on uber]) then just pay me like $10-$300 and I'll be happy, you're working for your own money there what I do isn't necessarily important just helpful
if it's a software you want to sell if it's a good idea that solves a problem I'm happy to make it but like 1% or 0.5% of the sales or if it goes public like stock would be cool, but again the money doesn't matter so much to me I'm fine living, it's helpful but let's talk project first before talking cuts, my only request is that even if not public I have access to the code to show potential employers, I wouldn't make it public especially if it needs to be secure, but just being able to still own what I write and I don't just have to hand it over exclusively and delete everything afterwards that'd be lit
Rocky — 1/11/26, 2:09 AM
and yea that "best of 2 years" is a good plan I do like that, however I don't want to cause more stress especially on a 5% cut, that'd be lit a 5% flat based upon what was made that year rather than having to match or do better than last year would be lit, even 2% at 1m in sales that's 20k which honestly after the service is made that's basically a free 20k I'm not doing much for, maybe some debugging/fixes or training/directing staff, but that's essentially 0 work 20k, so I almost feel bad with just that, if you had to match it every year I feel like it'd be more stressful than it needs to be this ain't a pension (as much as I do appreciate the offer) 😭😆
we can talk money more as it comes to fruition, but for now if you can give me

what the purpose?:

what the UI (graphics) should look like?:

what is the key idea of the program/what problem we're solving?:

what does it actually need to do? is it a shop? a service? what is being sold? is there something being sold is it a donation bin? 😂 crypto?:

just those 4 and I can get a pretty good idea of what needs to be done and actually have a direction to take it in from there I can send you updates and what's going on, and oh I actually kinda see what you mean with the payment, idk we can talk about it more don't worry so much about paying me I'm not that frugal, I'm happy on like a 1% flat tbh but we can work it out I wouldn't complain about 5% on that best of 2 years I am a little confused if you were to make 1m in the first year I'd get 50k, then if you made 2m the next year I'd also get 50k? bc 2nd year - 1st year = 50 then if you made 2m again the next year I'd get bumped to 100k? am I understanding?
Man — 1/11/26, 12:45 PM
You’d end up with 50K first year, and add 100K to that 50K for the 2million the next year, you’d have a total of 150K
Man — 1/11/26, 12:47 PM
I better get in while you still are doing coding like this!! Lol
Man — 1/11/26, 12:50 PM
The three apps would be “Triple A Musician” “Triple A Music” “Triple A Muse”.
Triple A Musician would be similar to the “Uber Driver” app, in that, the musician can see their rating, their bookings, their obligations, and see the perks they get like: Embroidery for branding, or free instrument rental for being a 5 star performer
Triple A Music would be like “Uber Eats” would be for the customer, connecting them to musicians and locations to host events
“Triple A Muse” would be like “Uber” both the performer and the costumer become the consumer, where they would rent the instruments, get lessons, look at places they’d like me to come and help them set up stages for their performance etc.
Rocky — Yesterday at 4:27 AM
would you want possible “subcontractors”/employees that you could assign specific tasks to as well on your end of the Triple A Muse app? For now I can just make it applicable to you but so I’m not rewriting code it’s best to have the broad picture in mind as well, I’m assuming it would be helpful but not super necessary to start?
And I like the plan, thx for laying it out so clearly, I’ll start ASAP, I’m trying to fix some issues with the clash bot but it’s just a headache bc of code reasons and my ability with my personal setup atm so I might just start
would you prefer a containing app for all 3 and have each be like a “subapp” or do you want 3 truely individual but interconnected apps? this is mainly just for my own setup sake so I know if I should make 3 buildable executables/program files or if I should setup the project to make just one, this can be changed later pretty easily I’ll probably setup the project simularly either way but just curious as to the vision you have in mind? would you like it to be one app where then the user can go to “musician” “music” or “muse” or do you want 3 independant apps like “Triple A Musician™️” “Triple A Music©️” and “Triple A Muse📑”?
Man — Yesterday at 10:54 AM
Yes, I would want that.
Man — Yesterday at 10:55 AM
I’d like 3 truly individual apps. Basically 3 separate businesses.
