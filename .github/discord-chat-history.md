musician page is the most dire redesign needed, I'll try to set up the host panel and musician pages to be better
those links will be live for the git repository though so it will always be the most up to date version if I've made edits
any comments or anything feel free to share

Without multiple developers, I believe You will make more than the minimum just based on my hypedness to promote people to use the app, or website to pay lol. Even if there are glitches, the ground work Im going to do to promote these sites is going to cause these sites to crash and burn, or miraculously float without a crazy amount of developers. Once I hire other developers though, and our partnership is through based on me having full ownership of the sites, the best of 2 years would be terminated, and you would receive your minimum, or whatever 5% is (whichever is more)… but we have to also make sure we establish what you have to complete before I receive full ownership which commences the minimum payment. I would think the site has to make 5K to prove it is functional, before you can cash out. 5% of 5K is $250, which times that by two is $500 not $1000, which means you would get the $1000 before your 5% earned it if you wanted to cash out. That seems fair to me.
Rocky — Yesterday at 8:25 PM
yea, I could care less about the money, I'm happy to continue to work as the site grows, just notifying you in advance that if this does scale we will probably need a team of more than just me
keeping a server running, let alone multiple servers is either expensive or really difficult
or both
idk we'll figure it out as it comes to fruition
like I enjoy the prospect of money but I'm in this for the long haul a good relationship with a reputable business is much more valuable than any money
Man — Yesterday at 8:38 PM
I love music, I couldnt care less about money as well! Developers keeping track of code is like business people keeping track of money. Money tracks to people who are accountable, and it in itself is the coding of the business. Residual is like ai, the better the residual income, the better the tracking, the better the identifying of great minds is. It is my desire to create a full proof plan that satisfies the code of good business, just like you desire to identify good code through successful ai programming.

Triple A Music would basically be a Music Label which would fund, produce, market, and distribute an artist's music, handling logistics, financing, and promotion in exchange for ownership of recordings and a share of profits, providing artists with teams for A&R, legal, branding, and career development. Basically the best of the best TripleAMusicians would go there, and the customers would go to TripleAMusic to see the cream of the crop. Triple A Muse would help consumers find local artists and all the minor things.
A&R (Artists and Repertoire) is the division of a record label responsible for talent scouting, signing new artists, and overseeing their artistic development.
Rocky — Yesterday at 10:29 PM
ah so you're trying to be more of a label and logistics service than anything else, did not realize that I will fix that
so do you want to handpick artists displayed on music, or do you want it to be algorithmic based on popularity and if they are like a "premium" or listener-popular artist (this could pull spotify statistics or other platforms)?
Man — Yesterday at 10:35 PM
You dont have Muse wrong or Musician wrong. Muse is basically the top priority, then musician, then music… who the community is championing would basically get signed. The music videos, and the streaming service of musicians would be on Music. And yes I would want it to be algorithmic based on popularity.
Anybody I promote on Music, would just have extra promotion on there. Music would have previous performances from local artists that arent signed and are signed, only I would want the people I sign to have visibility over everyone else even if they werent as popular. I would mix popular in with the signed people
What if Triple A Music also allowed people to pay to watch live events through twitch or something… donating or something. Maybe Im adding too much to keep track of smh.
Rocky — Yesterday at 10:40 PM
so music kinda as a marketplace for tickets and smaller events, almost tailoring to the small audiences and venues, muse as the main platform you want people to be on buying tickets for larger events or tours for artists, some advertisements could be ran on music but music is like a platform for artists to advertise themselves to potentially get booked, and it's possible but idk if it is with twitch idk if there are private streams like that I think I could definantly implement it though if you want a whole streaming service as well
it's easier to implement youtube into it, but it's possible to make a custom service
defiantly a later step but I will keep that in mind, what are the target audiences for each, bc I was thinking music was meant to be the place for tickets, muse was like the main advertisement/funnel to get people onto either site but also sell them on products, and musician was like purely for musicians, am I missing something/off?
music is the place for tickets, possible rentals, hosting events, that sort of thing
but idk?
Also what's up with Man & WAM in the server? Is WAM Jelly? or your second account?
Man — Yesterday at 10:52 PM
Keep what you originally had
Music would still be where people get tickets
Youre right
Man — Yesterday at 10:57 PM

MUSE ISNT FOR TICKETS, BUT YOU CAN BOOK ARTISTS ON THERE.
For Music, ticket sales for Triple A Music promoted artists would be prioritized, for Muse, you could put together an assortment of musicians such as drummers, pianists, sax players, singers.. (so you can get an uber to Taco Bell, the gas station, and the train station). whereas Music would be where you get the Taco bell delivered, because you found the mainstream stuff you like, and you dont need as much direction. Music is not where you get lesson, rentals, embroidery, it’s where The premium branding level embroidery print press advertisements for the performer etc is displayed for the consumer like an Uber Eats.
Man — Yesterday at 11:28 PM
Muse and Musician make Music what it will be… Uber Driver and Uber is why Uber Eats can exist.. gotta establish the driver (Uber Driver) and the customer (Uber) before you can show Mcdonald’s you have the means to broker customer and delivery for them where they had no delivery… so basically Music is less important based on how it doesnt exist without Muse or Musician, but it’s more important in that it will make more money than both of them combined based on the opportunities created by both of them.. Basically put Music out of your mind until Muse and Musician are established and Music will make more sense. Tickets dont matter without the consumer base which is developed by Muse and Musician. Muse is like an event coordinator, select “wedding, funeral, cruise, party, graduation” and then check mark select “Drummer, or pianist, or vocalist, or Master of Ceremonies blah blah” you’ll select the artists you want then select “local venue options” then select “event set up packages, speakers, etc” you can select “preferred genre”..
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:39 PM
lol I'm dumb I just realized that logging back in I was like "oh it could be his mini" yea that makes sense
so muse is to browse concerts and possibly book a concert, someone could start a venue request from music but that flow should take them through muse?
"venue request" like person requesting artists to apply a concert for a specific venue they are posting on the site/hosting at?
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:47 PM
that flow would go through muse because that is where you really want hosts and concert goers\* to be, music is the inbetween "marketplace" (still everything is interactable for baseline requests, tailoring to the most customers?
Man — Yesterday at 11:48 PM
Basically Music, would be me putting events together for 5 star artists, and consumers would go there to see what Mcdonald’s has on the menu coming up. Music is where you can basically see promoted musicians, venues, and tickets. Muse is where you would put it together yourself.
There is overlap between uber eats and uber, because the consumer is on both of them
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
Ok yes I understand, cool thank you that is good insight, doesn't really change what I'm doing at the end of the day but it is important to get details about the structure you want so I'm not refactoring 100x over, thank you for the input, if you think of anything else feel free to share otehrwise Ima lock in (no promises it'll be on the site that much I might work a bit on it, but I want to get NES DK to work on my emulator and then go to bed). I'll feed this chat to the agent and ask it to revise though
Man — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
No rush bruv
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:50 PM
And yea I getchu, they can be on either and they interact simularly, but each is a different service, for you you don't necessarily want different services but different offerings of your service
Man — Yesterday at 11:52 PM
The driver is required to drive… for uber eats and uber
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:52 PM
Like same sort of ideas and offerings on each, but music is more handpicked, flashy get people in the doors and to the events you're really pushing, muse is the "DIY" setup a concert you need an artist at or whatever, tickets can be bought here but it's more of an open marketplace, musician is self expanitory
Man — Yesterday at 11:54 PM
(Triple A Muse/Music/Musician, the As stand for, Acoustics, Acapellas, Accompaniments.)
Rocky — Yesterday at 11:55 PM
and ye that makes sense, I didn't realize uber eats and driver were one in the same though I thought it was two seperate accounts, not to take away from the analogy the point is that wherever the artist, customer or whomever is on they should be able to easily navigate to where they want to go and they should have the opportunities available to them presented clearly like how uber says "Want to drive?" => "Be a eats driver" OR "Drive around people" but like it's all clearly there and in that one Uber platform, you want it to be concise and well organized not necessarily laid out exactly the same
?
Man — Yesterday at 11:56 PM
Yes
They arent the same, but “Uber Driver” gets deliveries from both
Rocky — 12:01 AM
ahh I see, I hate to be dumb but like how does that relate to the layout you're going for? Musicians get notified for new gigs & venues, patrons of Music can post gigs, Muse is used as the ad "front" and helps navigate users where they want to go, how does the "getting deliveries from both" correlate... like to what type of user..? all of them?? or...?
Man — 12:01 AM
It’s easier for the performer.. the customer on the other hand, has to choose if they do the complex Muse, or the simplified Music where someone booked an event and left tickets open to save money on their purchase if people wanted to scout and come..
If someone goes to Muse and wants a drummer, they would be able to see the local drummers and it would transfer them to Music to see their performances, their rehearsals, their star rating and reviews. Or is that dumb?
Or should we just keep that info on Muse
Rocky — 12:05 AM
Nah, I think music if you want that to be the main storefront and muse to be your funnel, having a broader range of content will help SEO for more generalzied terms, and if the service is the most used it'll probably take top spot really easily when searching for any of the three or maybe second result when searching for triple A, google's algorithms are always kinda iffy, if you think the site should work some way we can make it work that way and if it's not good we can revise
Man — 12:10 AM
So what would you say is the most used for Uber U-Eats and U-Driver, and which would you say Muse Music Musician are in relation to the Ubers, or are they not the same at all or just similar?
Rocky — 12:16 AM
I think they can be similar, I'm just confused because the services are very different I guess, the roles don't quite align with some of the comparisons, I think I understand what you want, you want musicians to be almost like drivers, they should have essentailly total control over their schedules (with respect to yours if they need you or your team there), event planners [I've been calling them hosts] and event goes are both technically riders/eaters, hosts have slightly different workflows than customers because they can set up venues requesting artists but the artist has the ability to accept or deny that "ride" [if using the uber analogy], I guess my confusion is from just what you mean by "They arent the same, but “Uber Driver” gets deliveries from both" like true I'm just confused how you want that implemented into the site if you do want it implemented into the site somehow, ig I'm more confused if it's an idea you're throwing out there or if it's just a statement to get the purposes across better, it makes sense in the second context I'm just really tired and idk which context it is lol
sorry I'm dumb ah hell I've been staring at code too long today, woke up at 7am to drive nat to school to get home and talk about my school code with a TA it's been a long day lol
Man — 12:18 AM
For example, On Musician, should there be an option for the artist to “Rent Out Equipment on Muse”??? Since the musician is being sub contracted like an Uber Driver.
Rocky — 12:19 AM
OHHH
ah ok I see, community sourcing as an even larger marketplace than I was expecting
Man — 12:19 AM
Bro, you are extremely intelligent.. dont ever play yourself GUY! You are digesting this, and putting this together causing perfect synthesis!
Rocky — 12:23 AM
yea that's chilling, it's possible though I'll probably gate it behind an env flag so you can enable/disable it, you should definantly talk to a lawyer before doing that because your company may become liable for damages in some fucked up way if a bad actor/clumsy person ends up renting something and damaging it, you have to look into that and either get a signature of no protection and released liability for damages or problems to the instrument or get people on a "self-insured" plan, or you can try to figure out how to do that but that becomes a massive liability thing being a rental agency with the expectation people will not damage things and that's basically the rental premise, noone will want to rent things out on there and if they did it'd probably be difficult to get the released liability with instruments worth thousands, it'd probably fall on you to either do a bg check (I can automate that as well but it costs money unfortunately to my knowledge) or get a no liability waiver (which'll probably be damn near impossible)
if you want to do that look into the legality, ChatGPT is actually really fire with legal advice, ask specific questions about anything confusing, at the end of the day nothing beats a good lawyer, but for planning that works, for now I'll implement the rentals with env flags so they can be quick enabled and disabled. It'll apply to all routes and UI so nothing shows and nothing is callable
Man — 12:25 AM
I would insure them, they could choose not to get insurance like Turo. have you heard of Turo?
Rocky — 12:26 AM
Yea, let me know what the costs are associated and I can wire that up, for now I'll keep everything env gated, if you let me know what agency you want to use I can try to find an API so it like autogenerates a policy and everything
Fr I'm so sorry to say this but I could care so much more about finding an API for generating fucking insurance claims, lmk whatever service you decide/use rn I'm sure there's an API
but actually look into it first because reimplementing this might not be as easy as swapping some names, most payment and financial APIs are very precise
Man — 12:28 AM
Lol it was just a thought, it isnt important to the grand scheme lol. Im not married to it lol
Maybe another example would be, If an Artist is at an apartment that has an ideal event space, they could also be the ones to register for another artist to perform an event there?
Maybe Im forcing the Musician Uber Driver correlation too. hard lol
Rocky — 12:29 AM
very litte overlap between them as well, similar in principle but every function is a different name taking different parameters and each has it's own way it needs to be setup, that said reimplementation wouldn't be easy. And yea for sure I can make sure musicans have the same permissions as hosts, if not the same dashboard access they'll have the same abilities from their dashboard.
Nah it's a good correlation I think I was just confused as to what you meant bc I wasn't quite grasping the scope
TBH when you develop software more time is spent at the whiteboard and mockup drawings than time is spent coding most often, it's important to make the points clear as to what you are trying to achieve bc if someone doesn't understand it you'll be running in circles for hours
Like my last group project in my web dev class, 4 days spent planning the idea and drawing mockups and doing very basic setups to structure it all correctly, then like 2-3 days implementing, this was a group of 4/5 so to get the message across so everyone understood and knew their tasks took 3 or 4 days, software is an idea before anything else the clearer the idea the easier it is to build
Rocky — 12:41 AM
yo man if you're still up can you do one super quick review for me, do you like this setup for muse? it needs to be revised a bit but the general concept having the search/schedule event? https://tripleaevents.netlify.app/muse/
better or worse?
Man — 12:45 AM
I need to make the idea super clear.. Maybe I should take some time to do that, so you dont run yourself into the ground..
Rocky — 12:47 AM
Nah this conversation has been pretty good in shaping the key principles, muse should be a place for advertisement/featureds mainly, music for concerts near the user or popular, maybe some featureds, music should also be the place to post a venue or reach out to an artist to play a gig. Musician is the artist place
Idk why AI generated that but am I correct in that statement ^?
Man — 12:54 AM
The only issue with Muse, it all looks perfect, but the home page would also have lessons available somewhere small at the bottom, and rent instruments. Also, maybe a registered Musician logged in, can book another Musician like an engineer, and pay them to help them complete a project? Or is all this too much for the site?
Oh! You do have rentals on there!
It’s perfect!
In order to book a private session with a Musician, you would also have to be a registered Musician…
Rocky — 1:00 AM
Yur, I don't think there's meetups yet, I'll add that in and like an inbox for notifications, I'll work on the artist page next, I'm fixing some db errors rq
Man — 1:01 AM
Bro, dont kill yourself. You seem in a good groove, but I know it’s early morning for you… you’ll catch fire again. My bad for keeping you going so long!!
I just realized the time for where you are!

The Robot or what?
Rocky — 1:08 AM
lmao the tune
Man — 1:08 AM
Lol
Rocky — 1:08 AM
uhh there are testing accounts as well to test the flow through the app

Demo users exist with password test:

admin@admin.com
music@music.com
musician@music.com
muse@music.com
you can login with any of these, all three should work on music & muse, only musician should be able to access musician, admin has all site access and admin dashboard but idk I haven't reallt tested that much
Man — 1:10 AM
Bruv, night night. Im going to bed. My brain isnt speiabfks dkse ssusiws
Lol jk. My brain is fried
Log in to what?
Muse?
Oh, music and muse.. see, my brain registered nothing I read lol
Great work mate… super locked in!!!
This is a better website than most ALREADY. I remember talking about Pizza Hut, and how you can modify the pizzas… it’s coming along, absolutely.. glad we cleared so much up!

you want an invite? I got ticket scanning setup but I still need to test tickets
Man — 1/27/26, 1:04 PM
Yeah I want an invite!
Man — 2/4/26, 10:09 AM
I hade a few ideas for the website! If you are done with the project you intended, I can pay you and you can transfer full ownership over to me? Havent heard from you in a while! Checking to see if everything is okay?!?
Rocky — 2/5/26, 2:24 PM
Sorry, been busy with school, no need to pay me, I'll write a license so that the files technically belong to you, everything is fine it's just midterms so I've been stressed and busy, sorry for going AWOL for a bit
& the project I wanted to work on isn't quite done I keep getting side tracked, but yes kinda I just have to bring my PC up to my parent's house which I can do soon, then I can have it running up there actually hosting the server which then I can have things like live chat running without having a monthly fee outside of electricity and internet (which is getting paid anyways), payment processing handling and such is already set up, now it's kinda just what services do you want to offer, how exactly do you want it laid out, which I have a pretty good idea of but it needs refinement, I'll send you an invite right now to test it but it's not in a finalized state, and it may take a couple days of setting up the project on my home server for it to be up running and working 100%
If you want to own the servers and everything you can, idk how you'd set them up yourself but it's possible, or you can pay someone like amazon but then the server isn't technically yours, the way I'll have it set up will be secure and safe, and quick for development + essentially free, you don't need to worry about paying me I'll figure out the license thing tn, I'm sorry progress has been a bit slow over the past couple of weeks
past week
Rocky — 2/6/26, 12:31 AM
Licensing has been added, also what happened in clash?? I got on today and you're gone from the main clan then Nat was doing her battles and you're gone from the second as well, everything ok you just need a break or what's up?
Man — 2/6/26, 9:47 AM
If the license came over to me, I would probably terminate it, as I do not desire to work on the website alone. I would only enjoy building this with someone who pours into it in a way that encourages me as you have! Im not interested in you publishing it; I would have you take a year before you finalize it, but Idk what sort of timeframe youre on with your deadlines. If anything, I would want to take myself completely off the project.
I think it’s time for a new spark for Big Brain. New leadership is probably a good idea. There are some vibes Im feeling from people that are basic members that want to be elders, and when people become Co-Leader it’s often to go die off which you were exhibiting, and Nat immediately exhibited, and LeCream Exhibited, and 25ths, and Aries, and the list goes on and on… plus Ares built this club with Blake and his buddies, I bet they’ll come back and spark the team.. Also, I made a rule the first day that the lowest 400 on the team would get kicked, then Jimbo commented, and I told him it’s impossible to get 400, so I said I would kick myself if I did, and proceeded to get 400 to 3 level 16 matches and 1 hard counter match. I also think people hate the game now, and they just wanted to stick around to watch the club fall apart… I also have 3 girls and a wife that I need to focus more on. I left a one star review on the apple app server for Clash.
Man — 2/6/26, 10:00 AM
You dont have to work on the website, I just gotta know you arent abandoning it, or that you dont have a deadline that will make the site something we both cant confirm we agree on the finality of. I know you have school. I wanted to tell you some ideas, but I dont want to expect anything from you, so it’s easy to try to take responsibility from you so you can be free, or to give you full control so you can meet any goal that is less strenuous than what Im asking. Now that Im not playing Clash, it feels weird to just be all business with you bruv. Dont want you to feel Im going AWOL, or that Im on your back about it now that Im not playing the game.
Rocky — 2/6/26, 5:26 PM
mad resopect, clash is some honky bs, it's very little fun now-a-days, same thing happened with coc, I would get right to the verge of being max and in those upper leagues then they would introduce another town hall, it's disheartening tnh
tbh\*
it feels like the bar for being good keeps shifting and it's just not quite enough, but like spend a couple hundred and you could be above that bar, it takes alot of fun out of the game, respect for focusing on your family, and no I'm not quitting the site I've just been busy, I made the license agreement & I'm working on getting the host seat/stage setup working so users can actually set up their seating arrangements and reserved seats actually work/can be chosen
Man — 2/7/26, 12:00 AM
Oh, and, you and Nat can abandon the B team if you want. Didnt mean to put that on you!
Rocky — 2/7/26, 8:22 PM
lol, maybe, lotta people left
honestly it's kinda nice to not have the stress of winning, but it's also rough to see everyone gone
Image
Man — 2/7/26, 9:35 PM
Who left?
Rocky — 2/7/26, 10:52 PM
eman, green, chilledfetus, ridley, handingoutLs, eliteJXL and I think I'm missing 1 or two
oh yea ultra iq and probably a couple more
Rocky — 2/7/26, 11:20 PM
bank account linking for automatic payouts from concerts is setup, I'll tie it into the host setup as well
Image
Rocky — 2/8/26, 12:50 AM
musician onboarding is pretty much complete, users can now sign up and actually provide their linked account information so payments get sent directly to them after a gig
Man — 2/8/26, 12:47 PM
Should I come back, or is it over?
Man — 2/8/26, 1:02 PM
REHEARSAL/TRYOUT IDEA
The people who are hiring musicians should be able to choose multiple drummers (Or whatever musician type they want) for rehearsal and pay a deposit of a particular amount for a group of drummers, and a particular amount for the hours of rehearsal for that group, and whichever person gets chosen receives a higher percentage of the total.

CUSTOMER/MUSICIAN RATING IDEA
5 star rating plus gold blue purple rating (a stars equate to professionalism, and color equates to like-ability. 4star Gold musician is a popular 4 star person)the stars are based on how fast a person can learn a piece, how good they are at playing it, etc. If someone couldnt learn music in two weeks, and a customer had an event in two weeks, the only people who would pop up in the search based on the chosen event date are the kind of people that can memorize in two weeks.
Gold, light gold, Blue, light blue Purple, light purple is the popularity rating. This gradient rating scale could make a 1star musician famous like Ice JJ Fish (idk if you’ve heard about him, watch a youtube video lol)

MUSIC SUGGESTIONS IDEA
Having a wedding, or funeral, or party?? A few music composition pieces as suggestions for the kind of party the person is looking for would be nice.. When they pick the piece for the wedding, having interchangeable instruments playing the same piece would be interesting.. kinda like a tool for people to find their musician, and their song.. this might be too much, but just an idea.
