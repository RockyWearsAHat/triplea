it is a plausable investment but in my opinion money like that can be used for much better things
the .orgs are all $7.50 a piece
so $22 total
for all 3

Im sure if the business is successful, I’ll have the 20K to make that investment, so I like org
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:15 AM
I don't have to bundle it on the web either, I can just make a standalone app if you prefer, just for development though having a site you can view and comment on is easier bc it's live for both of us all the time rather than you having to download something or run it on a computer every time
Man — 1/14/26, 1:15 AM
Do you have a way I can transfer the funds to you for that?
Bundle is fine
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:16 AM
and yea, also you can keep the .org and just add the .com later on, it's basically just 4 values you gotta type in the right spot, and yea dw about that rn I doubt they'll be gone anytime soon, but if you want to zelle me and I can lock them down for a year my phone is 4357317654 or email alexwaldmann2004@gmail.com
so like the .org and .com could point to the same location, just two different domains
honestly I think .org sounds more professional like .organization, idk might just be me lol
Man — 1/14/26, 1:17 AM
I agree
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:17 AM
Here actually can you just do it so you actually own the domain name and it doesn't fail if my card doesn't go through
then you also have the ability to prolong subscriptions, auto renew all of that
I don't want to make a full account for you like I did Nat bc passwords are a bit more personal info than I need 😭

Once you've paid for them it'll be yours for a year, you can choose to autorenew so you don't lose it, I think renewal is like $10 each? idk it says in small text beneath the price
I will only need some very small things from there and I'm sure you are more than able to set it up, plus if you do get the .coms in the future you already know how to set them up, don't feel like you need to do it tonight but just so it's actually tied to your name and you are the rightful legal owner of the domain you should buy it
I could buy it for you but then technically it's in my name and my responsibility and honestly I already run 2 accounts with like 4 domains, I would prefer it to just be auto on your card given I'm a broke student and there's a 50/50 shot that renewal payment isn't going to be good 😆

Where do you want the admin page wired in? like admin.tripleamuse.com? any admin. prefix? no admin. prefix at all just a default login form for all users?

Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:43 AM
sorry, admin login and also admin, it can really simply be like /admin (I'll do that for the time being) but if you prefer the admin. prefix I'm happy to change that

Password is “ROCK2026!”

Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:46 AM
oh word, uhh ik this is a strange request but could you buy the domain names themselves? It'll let you 1) write it off as a business expense and 2) in case my autorenew fails (bc I'm broke as shit lol) it won't just remove the domain name from your presense, I'm happy to set it up for the time being but you should later on change the fallback card and prolly the password
for now though I'll set it up if you want to reemburse me I can send the final reciept
Man — 1/14/26, 1:46 AM
I bought all the domain names under that password
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:47 AM
OH BET
ok lit, I will link the DNS/name servers in a bit
Man — 1/14/26, 1:48 AM
I dont understand this.. can you explain a little more what you mean?
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:48 AM
I'll probably be changing some things around with my hosting setup later on, but for now atleast we can get a decent running result, I'll just set it up on Netlify for rn [can be expensive as time goes on but for testing it's great and free]. I'll send you the links when they're live, when I get the final hosting setup running I'll get you a VPN key and my VPN program
Man — 1/14/26, 1:49 AM
Great!
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:49 AM
oh yea, sorry, DNS (domain name service) basically tells the webservers themselves (what stores the data and where) that that IP links to that name
"name servers" are just another name
basically without them every website would be like 12.124.248.12.32 (or whatever, just a bunch of numbers, "pure" IPs)
Man — 1/14/26, 1:50 AM
Admin prefix meaning “Admin” or “www”?
Rocky — 1/14/26, 1:51 AM
technically the full thing would be www.admin.domain.org but this can be configured so there is no www. prefix and such, it'd just show admin.domain.org in the URL
it's just a slight amount of seperation between users and admins, it doesn't really add any security or anything just preference on how you want it to look, at the end of the day though if you're wanting apps it really doesn't matter how it's done
Man — 1/14/26, 1:54 AM
I believe in you guy!

Hey on the Music site do you want "customers" (not event hosts but like the people who would go to the event) to be able to login (or not login) into "Music" and place orders for tickets? You could be like a seatgeek or tix24 or whatever it is for these venues if they end up using your site, would that be of interest to you? There could be a flat like 1% fee for using the site and we can always discuss and change where you want to draw profits from but I think it'd be good if it's a one stop shop to cater to artists and hosts of events, having a place for hosts to easily sell entry into their event would probably get even more cash flowing through and it would be even more incentive to work with you, like they literally just go through a form of either uploading the venue and allowing people to apply, or they themselves as the host can request a certain artist on a certain day/time, and then tickets are literally just a checkbox if they want them sold, no other sites they have to go through and all the money associated with the business (outside of merch being sold for artists on the site which could later be implemented but isn't currently) is flowing through you, I think it'd be beneficial and it would incentivize more people to use your service, I could even look into ways that this could be implemented with these already existing ticket vendor sites so tickets don't get oversold and your site accurately reports the seatcount left to these external sites, it could even be like an integration when the host can link to these other vendors and then tickets get posted automatically there as well (or atleast I'm pretty sure as long as there's an API it's possible I'm sure)
I'll send you the links to the sites later today I'll probably get them published to atleast a dev environment today, it might be on all one site just like music.whatever.com or muse.whatever.com for the time being given it's a monorepo and I don't want to split this into 3 repos/tinker with netlify for multiple days to get that to work, but however it's done I'll keep you posted, just would you be interested in also catering to people wanting to go to these events in/as the form of a/the ticket vendor for the event?
Man — 2:29 PM
I love that! Maybe this would be a good option for the artist to turn an “Open For Tickets” setting on or off depending on if we have the layout for the venue or not (assigned seeting tickets would cost more than “at the door” tickets), if they just want their friends to watch them, or if they are a 4star performer or better. This may be difficult, because there are so many places to perform that arent duplicated in other states, for example: Mcdonald’s is in every state, so Uber Eats just copies and pastes the menu, but a “Club X” is like one of 5000 places to sing, so getting layouts would be a lot more work. But I agree with you, and would 100% want to develop this idea as a secret feature artists get surprised, and hyped by.
And yes, I would like to be the ticket vendor
Rocky — 2:46 PM
The venue itself would set the seat capacity and then users could link to 24tix or whatever it is, idk if there is a way to get affiliate links or whatever we could deal with that when we get to it. The venue itself as it lists will set the seating capacity, musicians could apply to the venue or the venue host themself could request an artist at their price/at an offered price. The tickets would solely be based on the capacity of the venue that was set by the host not by the artist or by you or anyone else, each type of user should be able to set up their profiles/events/links/whatever so the site itself handles most of the logistics, the artist basically has their schedule and a dashboard where they can request things from you, "hosts" can post new venues/events looking for talent, and you and your crew basically act as orchestrators for getting the event setup, or your profit simply comes from ticket sales or just being the facilitator, preferably low fees like $1-2 for each ticket and maybe like 1% max of $20 on the venue (I think that's fair and customers/hosts would be happy to pay that for the simplicity, but feel free to lmk) or if you are booked to help setup you would get your pay for that as well obviously bc that's active work, but as a marketplace those would be your fees then whatever services you want to offer I'll try to make a way for them to easily be setup, but each category/service initial setup will probably have to be coded rather than just having like a dynamic system. All items within these categories could be dynamic (like all your instrument rentals, your different packages for setting up venues, but these different views like "Rentals", "Bundles"... etc would have to be set up by hand but I'll think on it if there's a better way). Either way I'll get the system working as a marketplace facilitator for as much as I can, it's complex but not difficult just alot
Man — 3:56 PM
I was interested in getting the layout of these places to be the exclusive ticket vendor. Uber Eats gets paid by the customer, and then pays McDonald’s. I was hoping to pay the Venue, and control everything over the top. I like the 24tix, I would just be unsure, because idk if they would sell tickets for a local lounge or something. I agree 100% with you, I just want to make sure I have everything covered.
