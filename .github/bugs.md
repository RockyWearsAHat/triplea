✅ **Apple-inspired bold landing pages plan ready** — Diagnosed and planned.

→ See [.github/plan.md](plan.md) for the Apple-style redesign:

- **Root cause**: Small cramped UI with max-width containers, modest typography (22-28px), too many attention-grabbers competing
- **Solution**: Full-width sections, massive typography (48-80px heroes), 1-3 focal points per viewport
- **Muse**: Full-height hero + two large path cards + mission footer
- **Music**: Bold "Find Musicians" title + centered search focal point
- **Musician**: Large greeting + prominent stats cards + clean grid
